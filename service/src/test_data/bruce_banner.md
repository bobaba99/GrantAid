# Profile
**Name**: Bruce Banner
**Program**: PhD in Biochemistry / Radiobiology
**Institution**: Culver University
**Research Field**: Biological effects of high-energy radiation, specifically cellular resistance and regeneration mechanisms.

# Research Summary
My research focuses on understanding how biological systems can withstand and adapt to high levels of gamma radiation. Specifically, I am investigating the potential for induced cellular regeneration in response to radiation stress, which has significant implications for both medical treatments of radiation sickness and general tissue engineering.
