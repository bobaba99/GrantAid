# Research Excellence at CIHR

## Understanding the Issue

To inform its conceptualization of research excellence, CIHR undertook several evidence-gathering activities: a comprehensive literature review; an international environmental scan; and an initial series of discussions with the health research community. These activities informed CIHR's understanding of how problematic behaviours, barriers and biases are limiting what is currently conceptualized as excellent research and who are considered excellent researchers (Figure 1).

In Figure 1, a flowchart illustrates biases, behaviours and perpetuation of systemic barriers associated with a narrow concept of research excellence. The left side of the figure, labeled 'CIHR's ecosystem realities,' highlights factors such as limited public funding, many qualified researchers, legislative imperative to fund "excellence." An arrow extends to the right indicating the need to identify and report on "excellence." On the right, a section labeled 'research ecosystem realities' includes incentive structures to identify and evaluate "excellence," leading to the consequences of hypercompetition, biases introduced within the research ecosystem, metrics-based assessment, and problematic behaviours and a lack of desired behaviours in some actors. Collectively, these elements contribute to a narrow concept of "excellence." Below the headings "CIHR's system realities and Research ecosystem realities," with two arrows pointing up, is the text "systemic barriers have influence over the entire ecosystem."

## Framework

CIHR believes that excellent research is rigorous, inclusive and conducted in ways that meaningfully integrate a diversity of perspectives, disciplines, and methods in order to maximize impact and benefit to society.

Excellent research recognizes that biological, socio-economic, cultural and experiential differences impact health and should be considered for research and related activities to be of benefit. An inclusive concept of research excellence positively influences who sets research priorities; who conducts, participates in and benefits from research; how research is conducted; and how it is assessed.

## Guiding Principles
The following foundational principles will guide CIHR's work in integrating a more inclusive approach to research excellence across its programs, policies and practices:
- Holistic: Research excellence is broad and spans how research is conceptualized, prioritized, taught, carried out, assessed, funded and used.
- Adaptable: Research excellence is not one-size-fits-all, but rather context- and content-specific. Flexible, catered approaches are required to recognize and incent the breadth of research within CIHR's mandate.
- Evergreen: Research excellence is a concept designed to be adjusted as new evidence emerges, and as science and society evolve.

## Key Components
The following key components should be considered and addressed within all CIHR-funded research whenever relevant and appropriate:

- Ethics: Excellent research must meet international standards of ethics.
- Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI): Research is excellent when it is inclusive, equitable, diverse, anti-racist, anti-ableist, and anti-colonial in approach and impact. Excellent research reflects the diversity of scientific talent in Canada, empowers participation of communities historically marginalized and disadvantaged in health research (including but not limited to women, Francophone researchers, Indigenous Peoples and organizations, persons with disabilities, and Black and other communities marginalized by race), and supports inclusion across the lifespan for research involving humans. Within this component, it should be especially noted that the right to conduct research in the official language of one's choice, which is protected through the Official Languages Act, is a key pillar of inclusion.
- Indigenous Knowledge: Guided by a spirit of reconciliation and co-existence, research must prioritize requirements of First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities and respect the self-determination of Indigenous Peoples. This involves building trust, respect and relationships with communities; recognizing Indigenous knowledge systems; learning and understanding culture; co-producing research to ensure questions and approaches are shaped by community priorities and remain in the community; presenting findings using accessible and community-centric approaches; and respecting Indigenous data sovereignty.
- Patient-Oriented Research: Excellent research includes meaningful engagement of patients, people with lived and living experience, and other knowledge users as partners throughout the entire research process. This approach helps to ensure questions and results are relevant and enhance the integration of findings into the health care system and clinical practice, with the goal of improving patient experiences and outcomes.
- Knowledge Mobilization: Excellent research employs tailored approaches for optimizing the impact of agency-funded research. Excellent research involves co-designing research priorities and questions with knowledge users, and/or mobilizing findings via a broad range of accessible and equitable formats to inform health-related decisions by policy makers, practitioners, patients and communities.
- Open Science: Excellent research incorporates open science practices that enable timely access and sharing of research findings, data and other outputs, in order to maximize the use and impact of agency-funded research.
- Scientific Rigour: Excellent research must use robust research designs that minimize bias across methodologies, analysis, interpretation and transparent reporting of results.
- Training, Mentorship and Sponsorship: CIHR recognizes the importance of training, mentorship and sponsorship in creating and supporting the diversity of talent needed to conduct excellent research. This includes valuing efforts to address gaps in training and support across all career stages, transitions, and paths, and to build capacity amongst groups currently underrepresented in the health research ecosystem.

## Evaluation

https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/54339.html

### Preparation
Recommendations:
- For those less familiar with the narrative format, allow more time for the review process.
- Read the objectives and evaluation criteria of the funding opportunity/program.
- Consult the tri-agency CV instructions and responses to frequently asked questions.

### Quality and impact
In alignment with DORA, peer reviewers must look broadly, beyond quantitative indicators of productivity, when assessing a researcher’s contributions and impacts. The scientific content of a paper is always more important than publication metrics or the identity of the journal in which it was published and thus peer reviewers should avoid using journal-based metrics (e.g., Journal Impact Factor) in their assessments. It is important to consider quality and impact directly, where possible, and to recognize and value a broad range of research contributions and impacts, based on the nature of the research.

Examples of indicators of quality include, but are not limited to, consideration of equity, diversity, and inclusion in all aspects of the research process; novel, creative, innovative, and/or suitable and rigorous methodology; building capacity of research trainees through mentorship; responsible and ethical research conduct; transparency and accessibility of results; and appropriate data stewardship.

Examples of indicators of impact include, but are not limited to, use of research results by stakeholders; advances to reconciliation and the decolonization of research; advances to state-of-the-art research or technology readiness level; economic, environmental, or societal contributions; increases to equitable and inclusive participation in the research ecosystem; increased public understanding of natural sciences and engineering, social sciences and humanities, or health aspects; influence on policy and standards, etc.; and influence on direction of thought. Surrogate measures of quality and impact, such as the prestige of a publication venue or citation-based metrics (e.g., Journal Impact Factor or h-index) should not be used as they introduce bias in the merit review process.

For additional examples, see the NSERC Guidelines on the Assessment of Contributions to Research, Training and Mentoring.

Recommendations:
- Avoid assessing quantitative metrics in isolation (e.g., number of publications and citations, size/number of research grants). In some research fields, metrics may provide useful context or help identify trends (e.g., citation patterns, interdisciplinary collaborations), but they should not be used as surrogates to assess the past productivity or capability of the researcher. Such metrics should only be considered in combination with a range of indicators of quality and impact.
- If discipline-appropriate metrics are included, consider them alongside more holistic measures of quality (e.g., distinctions-based, meaningful, and culturally safe research) and impact (e.g., health and societal contributions, scientific innovations, influence on policy and practice).
- Identify and consult relevant agency-specific policy tools – such as guidelines for the review of Indigenous research or discipline-specific guidelines, which can support reviewers in assessing the contents of the CV.
- Review the entire CV, as relevant information may be included throughout the various sections.
- Consider diverse forms of excellence – research can have a range of forms, outputs and impacts that result in academic, non-academic, professional, and community contributions.
- Consider the quality and the impact of all contributions, and their benefits to society as a whole.

### Lived and living experience and non-linear career paths
Lived and living experience refer to personal knowledge gained through direct, first-hand involvement in events. This information can be found in the personal statement section of the tri-agency CV. Applicants may also have non-linear career paths (e.g., they worked outside academia, started their academic career later in life, switched academic fields). These types of career paths should not be penalized.

Recommendations:
- Consider lived and living experience that have affected applicants.
- Review career paths holistically (i.e., consider all aspects of the career and interconnections) rather than focusing on individual parts in isolation.

### Limited opportunities for student and postdoctoral researcher training
Applicants may have had limited opportunities to train graduate students and postdoctoral researchers because their institution does not have a graduate degree program (e.g., applicants working at a small institution). Applicants have been instructed to specify this information in their tri-agency CV and to describe proactive strategies and other informal training or mentorship activities that they have undertaken to contribute to student and postdoctoral training.

Recommendations:
- Consider formal and informal training and mentorship activities.

### Self-contained information
The tri-agency CV should include all necessary and relevant information so that reviewers can understand, evaluate and make decisions based on the CV without needing to refer to other documents outside of the application (e.g., information on the web). The CV (along with the application) must stand alone and provide all relevant details to support clear and informed decision making.

The sole exception for which other sources may be permitted is for hyperlinks, but only if they are used to demonstrate audio/visual creative outputs, if applicable for specific funding opportunities. However, there is no guarantee that hyperlinks will be accessed.

Note that when applicants submit their application, they attest that they have provided complete and accurate information in the funding application and related documents.

Recommendations:
- Review the tri-agency CV without referring to other sources of information outside of the application.

## How to highlight your research contributions and impacts

https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/53584.html

CIHR wants to ensure that peer reviewers look beyond the traditional indicators of productivity when assessing contributions and impacts. We ask peer reviewers to avoid using metrics (e.g. number of publications and citations; size/number of research grants) in isolation and to avoid using journal-based metrics (e.g. Journal Impact Factors) as surrogate measures of quality and impact.

Historically valued
- Publications and citations
- Reports and books
- Prestigious awards
- Number/size of grants
- Knowledge mobilization outputs & activities
- Other valuable research outputs

Influence on policy and practice
- Public engagement (including public, patients, providers, policymakers/government, researchers, industry, mainstream and social media)
- Community-based participatory research
- Training & mentorship
- Volunteerism
- Guidelines, standards, software and tools
- Networks, collaborations and partnerships
- Datasets, code and infrastructure development
- Commercialized and open-access products

Tips
- Think broadly when choosing contributions and impacts to highlight
- Include indicators of quality (e.g., distinctions-based, meaningful and culturally safe health research) and impact (e.g., influence on policy and practice, health and societal outcomes) directly
- If relevant, provide context to support peer reviewers in assessing your track record (e.g., leave history, career stage, area(s) of research, experiential knowledge and lived and living experience, diverse career paths, family responsibilities, pandemic impact, barriers to entry facing individuals from underrepresented, rights-holding and/or equity-deserving groups)

## If I’m a student or postdoctoral researcher, how do I complete the section on supervisory and mentorship activities?
This section provides you with the opportunity to highlight your role in supporting the training and development of others in various settings. Think broadly by considering the different roles you have held within and outside of academia, including part-time or summer employment. For example, you may include experiences from activities such as:
- teaching, mentoring, supervising and/or coaching
- participating in science and/or research promotion
- participating in community outreach, volunteer work and/or civic engagement
- participating in departmental or institutional organizations, associations, societies and/or clubs.
Recall that at your discretion, and in consideration of the evaluation criteria and your career stage, you can tailor your tri-agency CV by writing the amount you deem appropriate for each section (1 through 3), so long as you do not go over the total page limit.

## Individual Development Plans

https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/50516.html

An IDP is a tool that supports graduate students and PDFs in actively preparing for the career(s) of their choice by exploring career paths, establishing career goals, and identifying skill gaps, culminating in an action plan to achieve their career goal(s). The use of the IDP presents an opportunity for self-evaluation, and also allows graduate students and PDFs to map their progress over time. Finally, IDPs serve as a communication tool between trainees and mentors (supervisor or other mentor(s)) regarding the training outcomes and expectations of both parties.
