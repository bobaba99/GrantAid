# Mission and mandates

The Fund's mission also includes promoting the training of the next generation of researchers and research excellence to contribute to the advancement of knowledge and the development of solutions to the societal challenges facing Quebec. It contributes to the sustainable development of society by stimulating the development of social and technological innovations. It promotes, in each sector, the reach and impact of research and its results in Quebec, elsewhere in Canada, and internationally.

The Fund's mandates are:

to promote and provide financial assistance:
free, fundamental or applied research in the three research sectors;
the training of researchers and career development;
the mobilization of knowledge;
intersectoral research activities.
to support the coordination of research initiatives carried out within government ministries and agencies and the management of resulting calls for projects;
to establish any partnership, both nationally and internationally;
to contribute to the support and enhancement of research and science in French.

# Vision and research fields

Research that vibrates with society and its diversity, for sustainable health, an essential resource for individual development and socio-economic prosperity.

# Research domains

The research fields have been revised and divided into four categories that fit into the four quadrants of the new conceptual framework illustrated by the circle below.

Each quadrant deals with health from a more specific perspective: from mechanisms to health disruptions, to health solutions, through systemic pressures on the individual and the community. The quadrants are porous and interact with each other, reflecting the cross-cutting, evolving and interconnected nature of the different fields of health research.

This conceptual framework should make it possible to better mobilize expertise (by inviting a broader research community to recognize itself as a contributor to one or more domains of the Health sector), to encourage intersectorial research and ultimately to transform results into concrete solutions for health and health systems challenges (two slightly different things) in a sustainable, accessible and equitable way.

## Health issues

This quadrant groups together the major health challenges that mobilize health research, care and services. It retains a pathological nomenclature that is comprehensible to a large number of stakeholders (healthcare professionals, decision-makers, etc.). It is complete enough to reflect provincial, national and international priorities (chronic diseases; emerging infectious diseases). Research work covers the entire continuum, from pathophysiology, incidence, screening, diagnosis and treatment development to public policy.
- Chronic diseases
- Oncology
- Immunology, inflammation, infectiology, microbiology, emerging infectious diseases
- Rare diseases
- Metabolism and nutrition
- Circulatory and respiratory health
- Digestive health
- Locomotor system
- Neurological diseases and psychiatry
- Mental health
- Public health issues

## Healthcare path
The focus here is on the trajectories of individuals and groups in their living environment and through the healthcare system, from the prenatal period through to aging. This quadrant will therefore make room for more specific windows of intervention over the life course, but also for social and environmental determinants (covering the natural environment – pollution, climate change – as well as the workplace, etc.) and their impact on health. It will also shed light on research addressing issues of equity and inclusion. Finally, it brings together research that looks at the design and evolution of health services, not just in the health system, by integrating different roles and actors.
- Pregnancy, fetal development, maternal health
- Childhood and adolescence
- Sex and gender differential health
- Aging
- Vulnerable populations, equity, inequalities
- Health and environmental exposures
- Health and social services policies
- Prevention and promotion
- Organization and management of health and social services
- Role and training of health and social services workers
- Patient-family-caregiver partnership

## Intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms

This category covers research aimed at understanding the internal and external factors that influence health and pathological transitions. This includes fundamental research on the basics of life (molecular, genetic, cellular), as well as research into environmental, social and behavioral and other determinants. Fields of research such as microbiomes or exposomes are named, appearing as some connectors between “inside” and “outside” the human body. Finally, “one health” is also mentioned here: while the field of research is extremely broad and certainly highly interdisciplinary, it is a reminder that human health research must integrate interrelations with environmental health and biodiversity.
- Molecular and structural bases
- Genetics, genomics
- Proteomics, metabolomics
- Cell biology, development, evolution
- Microbiomes
- Exposomes, environmental determinants
- Psychosocial determinants
- One Health

## Health engineering and digital health

This quadrant covers technological, social and organizational research and innovation in support of healthcare practices (inside and outside the healthcare system). It includes biomedical engineering, medical devices, the development of innovative therapies, computational approaches, and even innovations aimed at precision medicine (development of tools and implementation). It also includes research aimed at the eco-responsibility of healthcare technologies.
- Health technologies, biomedical engineering, instrumentation
- Digital methods, use of AI in biomedical experimentation, diagnosis, prediction, etc.
- Diagnostic and therapeutic innovations
- Solutions to disabilities, adaptation and rehabilitation
- Environmental and social impact of healthcare solutions

# Sustainable health

Research for "sustainable health" promotes the study of a broad spectrum of issues, placing the health and well-being of communities and individuals at the heart of its concerns. It involves establishing new questions that allow for an understanding of how to properly define potential routes toward better management of populations. More specifically, it focuses on precise targets: health promotion, early and adapted interventions, as well as disease prevention. Ultimately, it aims to reduce the burden and consequences of diseases, for optimal health results and a limitation of additional costs.

Sustainable health is part of a vast movement of health transformation. There are other health approaches that serve as responses to the disruptions of our era (e.g., pandemics, climate change, demographic evolution, and strained health systems) and which guide research, such as "One Health" and that of "Learning Health Systems." While the former is interested in the interrelations between human health, animal health, and the environment, the latter is interested in the gradual and continuous improvement of health care and services.

It relies on different fields of action:
- Efficiency of the health system
- Optimization or development of service corridors allowing for the management of health
- Better consideration of socioeconomic factors
- Better consideration of interactions with natural and physical environments
- Better consideration of individual factors
- Increased vigilance or adaptation in the face of threats or risks having an impact on health (e.g., climate change, pandemics, etc.)
- Others

And prioritizes certain domains or means:
- Digital health, artificial intelligence in health
- Integration of big data
- Research in real-world contexts
- Personalized health, including public health and population health
- Mental health
- Engagement of citizens
- Engagement of partners and new actors in health

The active and meaningful participation of civil society throughout research projects for sustainable health is essential for a better alignment with needs and to promote the appropriation of results by user settings. The contribution of diverse partners (public and private organizations, non-profit organizations, different levels of government including municipalities, etc.) as well as all health actors (nurses, social workers, occupational therapists, community organizations, etc.) is also indispensable for broadening perspectives and propagating research beyond hospital settings. Thus, research translates into impacts on a larger scale.

Artificial intelligence, digital health, the integration of big data, as well as precision medicine constitute levers of research for sustainable health. Applied as much to physical health as to mental health, these "tools" are essential to facilitate the management of our own health, a better management of access to health care and services—the "right patient, in the right place, and at the right time"—and the improvement of public services, to name but a few.

# SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT ACTION PLAN

## Action 1: Support research contributing to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals

Addressing the challenges associated with the climate and environmental crises requires a mobilization of all research disciplines covered by all of Quebec's research sectors and actors from society, both at the local and global levels, in order to better inform societal choices. This first action corresponds to Objective 9 of the FRQ 2022-2025 strategic plan, which aims to further mobilize the Quebec research community toward the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): climate, biodiversity, poverty, education, inequalities, health, security, and other interrelated issues.

In order to engage research in the achievement of the SDGs, including sustainable health, the FRQ will act on different levels. On one hand, it will stimulate the advancement of knowledge in these fields by offering, with the support of its partners, thematic programming on the SDGs that also contributes to Quebec’s priorities in this area, as well as by sensitizing its partners. This programming may fall within the four major societal challenges, as well as within the governmental and societal priorities of the FRQ's partners. Also, with the aim of sensitizing its partners to the role of research in achieving the SDGs, the FRQ will invite the latter to identify the SDGs during the launch of calls for projects.

## Action 2: Support the development of green skills in the next generation of researchers

In accordance with the specific objectives of each research support program, grant holders devote a significant portion of this funding to the training of the next generation within the framework of their projects: remuneration, scholarships, and scholarship supplements.

Increasing the number of research grants within the framework of targeted thematic competitions will allow for an increase in the number of students and postdoctoral fellows with essential skills to support and accompany Quebec’s energy and socio-ecological transition, whether they be organizations or individuals most at risk from the impacts of these transitions. These themes include: circular economy, clean technologies, responsible consumption, ecosystem protection, adaptation to climate change, sustainable bio-food, sustainable management of natural resources, just socio-ecological transition, transition of business models, social and solidarity economy including sustainable health. Sustainable health sits at the heart of the just socio-ecological transition. By aiming for an optimal state of health for the entire population, it encourages interest in disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, notably regarding access to services. It also conceives of ecosystem health as well as community planning as powerful allies in disease prevention and the promotion of human health.

## Action 3: Increase support for research concerning the green and responsible economy

The FRQ intends to pursue and develop new partnerships in order to constitute a lever to strengthen research capacity by combining the resources of each on themes falling within the circular economy, green sectors and clean technologies, as well as responsible consumption. These partnerships also allow for the definition of new avenues for knowledge thanks to the diversity of actors working around research questions contributing to supporting a transition toward sustainable business models. Moreover, thanks to the SQRI2 credits, the FRQ is intensifying intersectoral research on major societal challenges, notably on sustainable development, including the impacts of climate change and digital technology. Two indicators will serve to measure the FRQ’s support for research on the green and responsible economy; one concerns the circular economy while the other concerns green sectors and clean technologies. Several research grants cover both themes.

## Action 4: Increase support for research concerning a just socio-ecological transition including sustainable health

The FRQ develops partnerships in order to constitute a lever for strengthening research capacity on different themes, some of which are linked to a just socio-ecological transition including sustainable health. Within the framework of the SGDD 2023-2028, a socio-ecological transition refers to: "leaving no one behind" and resolving the social and ecological challenges that arise in this context. The themes of the just socio-ecological transition include, notably: a sustainable and resilient health system ready to respond to climate and human crises; the social and solidarity economy; the creative economy; the fight against poverty. Research on these themes may foster sustainable solutions. Some of these programs integrate, within the research teams, individuals from user settings, including community settings, allowing for the definition of new avenues for knowledge thanks to the diversity of actors working around these research questions and facilitating knowledge mobilization.

## Action 5: Foster sustainable financial support

In addition to supporting programs whose targeted theme is environmental, the FRQ has been sensitizing the research community to the environmental responsibility of their research projects, notably since 2019, and invites them to take measures to minimize them, within the framework of its Action Plan on Environmental Responsibility in Research. Sustainable financial support accounts for the support of targeted programs with an environmental theme on one hand, and grant programs aiming for research projects whose candidates complete the environmental responsibility in research section when submitting their application for support on the other. The number of programs varies from one year to another, notably due to the one-off nature of partnership programs. The baseline measurement corresponds to the targets of the SGDD with nearly 60% of programs considered as sustainable financial support. The FRQ intends to work on maintaining this high rate for the duration of the sustainable development action plan.

Research practices themselves can have negative impacts on the environment. Researchers can adapt their practices to make eco-responsible choices within the framework of their research activities. The FRQ intersectoral student committee (CIE) published a report in June 2023 titled, Eco-responsibility in research: findings, solutions, and impacts. Recommendations for universities and the FRQ are formulated in the CIE report. In addition to pursuing its current initiatives, the FRQ will engage in a concerted reflection on eco-responsible practices within the research community in order to identify additional measures to facilitate the responsible choices of the research community within the framework of research activities.

## Action 6: Evaluate the sustainability of FRQ's structural interventions

The 2025-2028 strategic plan will be subject to a sustainability evaluation. In the coming years, the FRQ will systematize this evaluation for other structural actions, for example, new policies and strategies aimed at the research community. It should be noted that the FRQ does not carry out interventions leading to a memorandum to the Council of Ministers and does not have standardized financial support programs—interventions for which a sustainability evaluation is required in the SGDD.

## Action 7: Increase the proportion of responsible acquisitions

The FRQ is committed to increasing the share of its sustainable and responsible purchases to contribute to the development of a green, prosperous, and socially responsible economy. More specifically, it will increase the share of contracts published in the Quebec government's electronic tendering system (SEAO) having an eco-responsible component—that is, linked to one of the 21 indicators proposed by the Ministry of the Environment, the Fight Against Climate Change, Wildlife and Parks (MELCCFP) to identify if an acquisition is responsible.
