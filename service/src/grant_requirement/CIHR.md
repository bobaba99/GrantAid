# Research Excellence at CIHR

## Understanding the Issue

To inform its conceptualization of research excellence, CIHR undertook several evidence-gathering activities: a comprehensive literature review; an international environmental scan; and an initial series of discussions with the health research community. These activities informed CIHR's understanding of how problematic behaviours, barriers and biases are limiting what is currently conceptualized as excellent research and who are considered excellent researchers (Figure 1).

In Figure 1, a flowchart illustrates biases, behaviours and perpetuation of systemic barriers associated with a narrow concept of research excellence. The left side of the figure, labeled 'CIHR's ecosystem realities,' highlights factors such as limited public funding, many qualified researchers, legislative imperative to fund "excellence." An arrow extends to the right indicating the need to identify and report on "excellence." On the right, a section labeled 'research ecosystem realities' includes incentive structures to identify and evaluate "excellence," leading to the consequences of hypercompetition, biases introduced within the research ecosystem, metrics-based assessment, and problematic behaviours and a lack of desired behaviours in some actors. Collectively, these elements contribute to a narrow concept of "excellence." Below the headings "CIHR's system realities and Research ecosystem realities," with two arrows pointing up, is the text "systemic barriers have influence over the entire ecosystem."

## Framework

CIHR believes that excellent research is rigorous, inclusive and conducted in ways that meaningfully integrate a diversity of perspectives, disciplines, and methods in order to maximize impact and benefit to society.

Excellent research recognizes that biological, socio-economic, cultural and experiential differences impact health and should be considered for research and related activities to be of benefit. An inclusive concept of research excellence positively influences who sets research priorities; who conducts, participates in and benefits from research; how research is conducted; and how it is assessed.

## Guiding Principles
The following foundational principles will guide CIHR's work in integrating a more inclusive approach to research excellence across its programs, policies and practices:
- Holistic: Research excellence is broad and spans how research is conceptualized, prioritized, taught, carried out, assessed, funded and used.
- Adaptable: Research excellence is not one-size-fits-all, but rather context- and content-specific. Flexible, catered approaches are required to recognize and incent the breadth of research within CIHR's mandate.
- Evergreen: Research excellence is a concept designed to be adjusted as new evidence emerges, and as science and society evolve.

## Key Components
The following key components should be considered and addressed within all CIHR-funded research whenever relevant and appropriate:

- Ethics: Excellent research must meet international standards of ethics.
- Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI): Research is excellent when it is inclusive, equitable, diverse, anti-racist, anti-ableist, and anti-colonial in approach and impact. Excellent research reflects the diversity of scientific talent in Canada, empowers participation of communities historically marginalized and disadvantaged in health research (including but not limited to women, Francophone researchers, Indigenous Peoples and organizations, persons with disabilities, and Black and other communities marginalized by race), and supports inclusion across the lifespan for research involving humans. Within this component, it should be especially noted that the right to conduct research in the official language of one's choice, which is protected through the Official Languages Act, is a key pillar of inclusion.
- Indigenous Knowledge: Guided by a spirit of reconciliation and co-existence, research must prioritize requirements of First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities and respect the self-determination of Indigenous Peoples. This involves building trust, respect and relationships with communities; recognizing Indigenous knowledge systems; learning and understanding culture; co-producing research to ensure questions and approaches are shaped by community priorities and remain in the community; presenting findings using accessible and community-centric approaches; and respecting Indigenous data sovereignty.
- Patient-Oriented Research: Excellent research includes meaningful engagement of patients, people with lived and living experience, and other knowledge users as partners throughout the entire research process. This approach helps to ensure questions and results are relevant and enhance the integration of findings into the health care system and clinical practice, with the goal of improving patient experiences and outcomes.
- Knowledge Mobilization: Excellent research employs tailored approaches for optimizing the impact of agency-funded research. Excellent research involves co-designing research priorities and questions with knowledge users, and/or mobilizing findings via a broad range of accessible and equitable formats to inform health-related decisions by policy makers, practitioners, patients and communities.
- Open Science: Excellent research incorporates open science practices that enable timely access and sharing of research findings, data and other outputs, in order to maximize the use and impact of agency-funded research.
- Scientific Rigour: Excellent research must use robust research designs that minimize bias across methodologies, analysis, interpretation and transparent reporting of results.
- Training, Mentorship and Sponsorship: CIHR recognizes the importance of training, mentorship and sponsorship in creating and supporting the diversity of talent needed to conduct excellent research. This includes valuing efforts to address gaps in training and support across all career stages, transitions, and paths, and to build capacity amongst groups currently underrepresented in the health research ecosystem.

# Priority-driven research/Research in priority areas (for aging research)

## Brain Health and Cognitive Impairment in Aging Research Initiative

https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/43629.html

The BHCIA Research Initiative will support research across the continuum from the healthy aging brain, to cognitive impairment and care for those impacted by dementia, as well as the wellbeing of their caregivers. New scientific knowledge generated by this investment will be shared widely with patients and their families, health care professionals, and policy- and decision-makers, through workshops, webinars, briefings, outreach campaigns, and other knowledge mobilization activities.

CIHR funding and CIHR Institute of Aging Strategic Programs
- Research on: Risk Reduction, Care & Support and Caregivers
- Training and Capacity Building
- Knowledge Mobilization Hub
- Impact: Innovation and implementation

Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging (CCNA)
- Accelerate progress in research on age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy body dementia. Established in 2014.
- Impact: Synergy between researchers

Dementia Research Funders Alliance
- Bring together key stakeholders in the brain health and dementia funding ecosystem in Canada. Through this alliance, we will leverage and amplify dementia research, identify the scope of current activities and identify research gaps and needs.

The key goals of the BHICA Research Initiative are risk reduction (1) care, programs and services (2) and caregivers/care providers (3) and also the cross-cutting components: capacity building and training (1), knowledge mobilization (2), and partnerships (3).

Through the BHCIA Research Initiative, CIHR will support research focusing on three main research areas: risk reduction; care and support; and, care providers and caregivers, in order to address three overarching goals:
- Create knowledge about resilience in brain aging, identify and reduce risks that could result in cognitive impairment, and mobilize knowledge to change approaches to brain health.
- Improve care, programs and services for people with cognitive impairment and dementia.
- Develop, evaluate, and implement strategies to improve the health and wellbeing of caregivers and care providers.

The BHCIA Research Initiative will also embed three cross-cutting components:
- Train the next generation of researchers working on brain health and cognitive impairment in aging.
- Mobilize knowledge for impactful uptake of research outcomes with an emphasis on health equity and Indigenous Rights.
- Foster, support and lead collaborations and partnerships and engage stakeholders in the delivery of evidence-informed solutions.

## Dementia Research and Innovation Funders Alliance

https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/53676.html

Key Objectives
- Encourage dementia research and innovation funders to speak with one voice to align their dementia research investment strategy across Canada.
- Provide a forum for funders to work together to leverage and amplify dementia research, promote capacity building and training, scan the current dementia research landscape, compile and analyze data of all Canadian funded dementia research, identify research gaps and needs, and mobilize knowledge gained through dementia research.
- Support and enable the delivery and implementation of the research component of the research and innovation pillar of Canada's National Dementia Strategy.

Our Mission
- Accelerate Research: We pledge to fund and support cutting-edge research and innovation that deepens our understanding of dementia, its causes, risk factors, potential interventions and also develop the next generation of researchers.
- Drive Innovation: We will foster collaboration across disciplines and sectors, encouraging novel approaches to risk reduction, early diagnosis, treatment, and care. Innovation is essential to improving the lives of those impacted by dementia.
- Leverage Data: We will document dementia research and innovation investments in Canada, including identifying needs, gaps, and/or emerging priorities. By doing so, we aim to create transparency and provide opportunities for collaboration to avoid duplication and improve the return on investment in brain health and dementia research.

- Raise Awareness: We commit to encouraging cross-promotion and amplification of messages that promote research findings and their implementation, raise public awareness about dementia, dispel myths, reduce stigma, and advocate for policy changes that enhance dementia care and research and innovation.

Guiding Principles
- Collaboration: We believe that our collective impact is greater than any one single organization. The Alliance fosters collaboration by hosting a unique forum for members to share perspectives and expertise. For optimal impact, we leverage the strengths of our member organizations and respond to their needs. We encourage open dialogue, knowledge sharing, and joint initiatives.
- Transparency: We commit to transparent communication, sharing research findings, funding analytics, and progress updates with the broader community. All members will retain their individuality and may act as appropriate in their own context. 
- Impact: Our actions will be guided by the potential to positively impact the lives of those living with dementia and their caregivers. We strive for tangible improvements in their quality of life.
- Inclusivity: We are committed to ensure the equitable access to resources and supports, and to actively promote participation of community members and underrepresented groups, as well as to support research that addresses the needs and perspectives of diverse communities.
- Long-Term Vision: We recognize that addressing dementia requires sustained effort. Our alliance will focus on both immediate needs and long-term solutions.

## Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA)

https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/18542.html

The Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) was created to enable research that moves beyond a snapshot of the adult Canadian population, and instead, aims to understand and observe the complex interplay between physical, social and psychological determinants of health over time. This source of data and biological samples will inform how Canadians age and the genesis of age-related disorders.

The aim of the CLSA is to find ways to help us live long and live well, and understand why some people age in a healthy fashion while others do not.

Findings from the CLSA research platform will:

- Contribute to the identification of ways to prevent disease and improve health services;
- Develop better understanding of the impact of non-medical factors, such as economic prosperity and social changes, on people as they age;
- Answer questions that are relevant to decision-makers to improve health policy and inform government programs and services;
- Generate new knowledge on many interrelated biological, clinical, psychosocial and societal factors that influence disease, health and well-being; and
- Develop Canadian research capacity and train future generations of researchers who will use the CLSA data and infrastructure to explore previously unimagined areas of research on aging.

The CLSA is currently in its third phase of funding (2021-2027). The specific objectives for the CLSA Phase III are:
- Continued implementation of the approved CLSA protocol, including two waves of data collection for the tracking and comprehensive cohorts, analysis of a core set of biomarkers and continued optimization of participant retention for a robust longitudinal cohort;
- Ongoing optimization of systems and mechanisms, including a communication and outreach strategy (that includes a data promotion plan) that will ensure responsible and timely access to high quality CLSA data and biospecimens, while meeting ethical standards and protecting the privacy of CLSA participants; and
- Continued evolution of the CLSA governance structure and business model to ensure long-term stability and sustainability of the platform and its related operations. This should include governance and decision-making, management and operating plans, succession planning, and strategies for partnership and collaboration that continue to position the platform as a world-class scientific resource.

## eHealth Innovations: Empowering patients, enabling better health care

https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/47342.html

The purpose of the eHealth Initiative was to develop, integrate, and evaluate eHealth innovations to improve the cost-effectiveness of patient and population-centred care. The initiative facilitated partnerships between technology industries and health system players, researchers and end-users such as patients/families and clinicians to create innovative approaches to health care delivery, and results showed that the Initiative improved outcomes and patient experience in priority areas and increased Canada's competitive position in the health-related information communication technology (ICT) industry.

Conditions for success:
- Person-oriented rather than technology-oriented solutions
- Driven by small-and medium sized industry partners
- Creation of health care innovation communities made up of partnerships between researchers, end users, and health system decision makers
- Formal evaluation methods and metrics to support buy-in from the health-system

## Healthy Cities Research Initiative: Goal and objectives

https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/51570.html

The HCRI is a strategic initiative with the overarching goal of improving health by maximizing the health-promoting potential of cities and urbanized areas in Canada and internationally. The HCRI will fund research that will generate a substantial body of evidence and build capacity within the research and practitioner communities around designing and implementing evidence-based interventions in urban contexts to improve population health and health equity. For the purpose of the HCRI, the term ‘cities’ is used broadly to refer to non-rural communities of various sizes.

Developed after extensive consultations with the research community and municipalities and government agencies, the three main objectives of this strategic program are to:
- Research Excellence
- Support healthy cities intervention research and implementation science on innovative, scalable, sustainable and equitable solutions, with a strong focus on complex evaluation for equitable impacts.
- Create capacity among trainees and practitioners in implementation science focused on inter-sectoral solutions for urban environments that promote health and health equity.
- Mobilize the use of evidence to support Canada’s cities in planning and implementing interventions in their unique environments.

There are six foundational building blocks of the HCRI. These funding opportunities have already been launched at least once and each one leverages pre-existing CIHR mechanisms or programs. Several of these opportunities are designed to be launched annually. They are built to be agile and respond to ongoing conversations with partners and the evolving needs of the research community while also providing the structure and foundation that work to achieve the HCRI goals and objectives. These funding opportunities are:
- Data Analysis Using Existing Databases and Cohorts*
- Healthy Cities Research Partnership Development Grants*
- Implementing Healthy Urban Policy Workshop*
- Health System Impact Fellowship in Healthy Cities*
- Fellowship in Research and Knowledge Translation on Urban Housing and Health*
- Applied Public Health Chair - Sex, Gender and Healthy Cities
* These opportunities have recurring launches.

## National Women's Health Research Initiative

https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/53095.html

We recognize that the term "women's health" is conceptualized and understood in a variety of ways. For the purposes of the National Women's Health Research Initiative, the use of the term women's health reflects an evolving concept, broadly including the multidimensional concepts of sex and gender. It refers to physical, biological, reproductive, psychological, emotional, cultural, and spiritual health and wellness across the life-course in the context of the unique intersecting concerns related to our bodies, our roles, our social locations, and our identities. The initiative goes beyond the sex and gender binary and welcomes the experiences and needs of all people who identify as a woman, girl, intersex, and/or an under-represented gender identity, including, but not limited to, Two-Spirit, trans, non-binary, gender fluid, and agender people.

The National Women's Health Research Initiative will advance a coordinated research program that addresses under-researched and high-priority areas of women's health and will ensure new evidence improves women's and gender-diverse people's care and health outcomes. It will also promote an intersectional lens to research and care to tackle persistent gaps for all women, including for Indigenous, Black, and racialized women, women with disabilities, and members of Two-Spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and additional sexually and gender diverse (2SLGBTQI+) communities. The Initiative will transform women's health research and practice in Canada by producing and implementing a community-based approach, committed to the principles of equity, diversity, inclusivity, and Indigenous Rights.

The National Women's Health Research Initiative will consist of two funding streams: the Pan-Canadian Women's Health Coalition, and the Innovation Fund (see components for more information).

The objectives the Pan-Canadian Women's Health Coalition - Hubs are to:
- Mobilize and scale-up newly generated and existing knowledge and models of care into effective, gender-sensitive, and culturally appropriate women's health and wellness services across Canada.
- Maximize research impact within and beyond the Coalition to help ensure evidence is integrated into health policy, decision making, and planning to support community, regional, provincial, territorial, and /or federal efforts regarding women's health.
- Build capacity for the next generation of women's health researchers through training and mentorship opportunities embedded within the hub to support the development of a sustainable women's health research ecosystem in Canada.
- Engage in community-based priority setting activities and identify future critical areas of women's health research based on community, regional and/or national needs.

## Network Environments for Indigenous Health Research (NEIHR)

https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/51161.html

The purpose of the NEIHR Program is to establish a national network of Centres focused on capacity development, research and knowledge sharing (KS) centred on Indigenous Peoples (First Nations, Inuit and Métis). The network of Centres is intended to provide supportive research environments for Indigenous health research driven by, and grounded in, Indigenous communities in Canada. The NEIHR Program will take a comprehensive approach to capacity building in Indigenous health research by concentrating on Indigenous communities and structural factors (e.g., educational systems, institutions, research infrastructures, policy apparatus) and by focusing on individual agency (e.g., supporting trainees and researchers).

The objectives of NEIHR are seven-fold:
- Support Indigenous community-based health research that reflects the priorities and values of Indigenous Peoples;
- Enhance the Indigenous community-based health research network environment that will support Indigenous leadership and research-related organizations with existing and new research infrastructures and platforms;
- Augment awareness, capacity and relevance of Indigenous health research that improves the health of First Nations, Inuit and Métis Peoples across all health research domains;
- Improve the understanding of Indigenous health research and Indigenous research paradigms through ethical and impactful partnerships between Indigenous communities and health researchers, scholars, professors and instructors, research administrators, policy and decision makers, and other parties with an interest in Indigenous health research;
- Engage Indigenous Peoples in Canada in leading and conducting health research and KS;
- Engage with researchers, Indigenous Peoples, and other relevant parties from different countries as appropriate, in order to advance the objectives of the NEIHR Centres; and
- Develop enduring NEIHR Centres with sustainable mandates to build research capacity, conduct research, advance Indigenous research paradigms, and carry out KS activities.

## Evaluation

https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/54339.html

### Preparation
Recommendations:
- For those less familiar with the narrative format, allow more time for the review process.
- Read the objectives and evaluation criteria of the funding opportunity/program.
- Consult the tri-agency CV instructions and responses to frequently asked questions.

### Quality and impact
In alignment with DORA, peer reviewers must look broadly, beyond quantitative indicators of productivity, when assessing a researcher’s contributions and impacts. The scientific content of a paper is always more important than publication metrics or the identity of the journal in which it was published and thus peer reviewers should avoid using journal-based metrics (e.g., Journal Impact Factor) in their assessments. It is important to consider quality and impact directly, where possible, and to recognize and value a broad range of research contributions and impacts, based on the nature of the research.

Examples of indicators of quality include, but are not limited to, consideration of equity, diversity, and inclusion in all aspects of the research process; novel, creative, innovative, and/or suitable and rigorous methodology; building capacity of research trainees through mentorship; responsible and ethical research conduct; transparency and accessibility of results; and appropriate data stewardship.

Examples of indicators of impact include, but are not limited to, use of research results by stakeholders; advances to reconciliation and the decolonization of research; advances to state-of-the-art research or technology readiness level; economic, environmental, or societal contributions; increases to equitable and inclusive participation in the research ecosystem; increased public understanding of natural sciences and engineering, social sciences and humanities, or health aspects; influence on policy and standards, etc.; and influence on direction of thought. Surrogate measures of quality and impact, such as the prestige of a publication venue or citation-based metrics (e.g., Journal Impact Factor or h-index) should not be used as they introduce bias in the merit review process.

For additional examples, see the NSERC Guidelines on the Assessment of Contributions to Research, Training and Mentoring.

Recommendations:
- Avoid assessing quantitative metrics in isolation (e.g., number of publications and citations, size/number of research grants). In some research fields, metrics may provide useful context or help identify trends (e.g., citation patterns, interdisciplinary collaborations), but they should not be used as surrogates to assess the past productivity or capability of the researcher. Such metrics should only be considered in combination with a range of indicators of quality and impact.
- If discipline-appropriate metrics are included, consider them alongside more holistic measures of quality (e.g., distinctions-based, meaningful, and culturally safe research) and impact (e.g., health and societal contributions, scientific innovations, influence on policy and practice).
- Identify and consult relevant agency-specific policy tools – such as guidelines for the review of Indigenous research or discipline-specific guidelines, which can support reviewers in assessing the contents of the CV.
- Review the entire CV, as relevant information may be included throughout the various sections.
- Consider diverse forms of excellence – research can have a range of forms, outputs and impacts that result in academic, non-academic, professional, and community contributions.
- Consider the quality and the impact of all contributions, and their benefits to society as a whole.

### Lived and living experience and non-linear career paths
Lived and living experience refer to personal knowledge gained through direct, first-hand involvement in events. This information can be found in the personal statement section of the tri-agency CV. Applicants may also have non-linear career paths (e.g., they worked outside academia, started their academic career later in life, switched academic fields). These types of career paths should not be penalized.

Recommendations:
- Consider lived and living experience that have affected applicants.
- Review career paths holistically (i.e., consider all aspects of the career and interconnections) rather than focusing on individual parts in isolation.

### Limited opportunities for student and postdoctoral researcher training
Applicants may have had limited opportunities to train graduate students and postdoctoral researchers because their institution does not have a graduate degree program (e.g., applicants working at a small institution). Applicants have been instructed to specify this information in their tri-agency CV and to describe proactive strategies and other informal training or mentorship activities that they have undertaken to contribute to student and postdoctoral training.

Recommendations:
- Consider formal and informal training and mentorship activities.

### Self-contained information
The tri-agency CV should include all necessary and relevant information so that reviewers can understand, evaluate and make decisions based on the CV without needing to refer to other documents outside of the application (e.g., information on the web). The CV (along with the application) must stand alone and provide all relevant details to support clear and informed decision making.

The sole exception for which other sources may be permitted is for hyperlinks, but only if they are used to demonstrate audio/visual creative outputs, if applicable for specific funding opportunities. However, there is no guarantee that hyperlinks will be accessed.

Note that when applicants submit their application, they attest that they have provided complete and accurate information in the funding application and related documents.

Recommendations:
- Review the tri-agency CV without referring to other sources of information outside of the application.

## How to highlight your research contributions and impacts

https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/53584.html

CIHR wants to ensure that peer reviewers look beyond the traditional indicators of productivity when assessing contributions and impacts. We ask peer reviewers to avoid using metrics (e.g. number of publications and citations; size/number of research grants) in isolation and to avoid using journal-based metrics (e.g. Journal Impact Factors) as surrogate measures of quality and impact.

Historically valued
- Publications and citations
- Reports and books
- Prestigious awards
- Number/size of grants
- Knowledge mobilization outputs & activities
- Other valuable research outputs

Influence on policy and practice
- Public engagement (including public, patients, providers, policymakers/government, researchers, industry, mainstream and social media)
- Community-based participatory research
- Training & mentorship
- Volunteerism
- Guidelines, standards, software and tools
- Networks, collaborations and partnerships
- Datasets, code and infrastructure development
- Commercialized and open-access products

Tips
- Think broadly when choosing contributions and impacts to highlight
- Include indicators of quality (e.g., distinctions-based, meaningful and culturally safe health research) and impact (e.g., influence on policy and practice, health and societal outcomes) directly
- If relevant, provide context to support peer reviewers in assessing your track record (e.g., leave history, career stage, area(s) of research, experiential knowledge and lived and living experience, diverse career paths, family responsibilities, pandemic impact, barriers to entry facing individuals from underrepresented, rights-holding and/or equity-deserving groups)

## If I’m a student or postdoctoral researcher, how do I complete the section on supervisory and mentorship activities?
This section provides you with the opportunity to highlight your role in supporting the training and development of others in various settings. Think broadly by considering the different roles you have held within and outside of academia, including part-time or summer employment. For example, you may include experiences from activities such as:
- teaching, mentoring, supervising and/or coaching
- participating in science and/or research promotion
- participating in community outreach, volunteer work and/or civic engagement
- participating in departmental or institutional organizations, associations, societies and/or clubs.
Recall that at your discretion, and in consideration of the evaluation criteria and your career stage, you can tailor your tri-agency CV by writing the amount you deem appropriate for each section (1 through 3), so long as you do not go over the total page limit.

## Individual Development Plans

An IDP is a tool that supports graduate students and PDFs in actively preparing for the career(s) of their choice by exploring career paths, establishing career goals, and identifying skill gaps, culminating in an action plan to achieve their career goal(s). The use of the IDP presents an opportunity for self-evaluation, and also allows graduate students and PDFs to map their progress over time. Finally, IDPs serve as a communication tool between trainees and mentors (supervisor or other mentor(s)) regarding the training outcomes and expectations of both parties.
