# Unified Document Format Requirements (CIHR + FRQS)

Rules:
- If both agencies require the same thing → listed once.
- If one is stricter → the stricter rule is listed (the lenient one adapts).
- If rules contradict → both are listed explicitly.

---

## 1. File Format and Protection

- **PDF format only, unprotected (no password)**
- **PDF portfolios are NOT accepted** (FRQS-specific but stricter)
- **Encrypted/secured PDFs must be recreated (e.g., scanned again)** (FRQS-specific but stricter)

---

## 2. Page Size and Margins

- **Page size: Letter (8.5 × 11 in / 216 × 279 mm)**
- **Margins: Minimum 2 cm on all sides**

---

## 3. Font and Typography

- **Font: Times New Roman, 12-point**
- **Text must be black** (CIHR explicit; FRQS silent → CIHR is stricter)
- **Character spacing must be normal (not condensed)** (CIHR explicit → stricter)
- **Superscript and subscript allowed**

---

## 4. Line Spacing

- **Single-spaced minimum**
- **Narrow or condensed spacing is forbidden** (CIHR explicit → stricter)

---

## 5. Headers, Footers, and Page Numbering  
*(Contradictory requirements → both must be listed)*

- CIHR:
  - Margins may include **page numbers only**
  - Headers and footers must otherwise be **empty**
- FRQS:
  - Header must contain: **Last name, First name**
  - Footer must contain: **Document name or title**
  - Pages must be **continuously numbered at the bottom**

---

## 6. Page Limits

- **Page limits must be respected exactly**
- **Extra pages are not allowed unless explicitly stated**
- Pages exceeding the limit may be removed before review (CIHR practice)

---

## 7. File Size

- **Maximum 2 MB per document** (FRQS stricter → dominates)
- If too large:
  - Compress aggressively
  - Convert PDF → JPEG → PDF
  - Reprint using PDF writers (e.g., CutePDF)
  - Optimize using Acrobat or equivalent

---

## 8. File Naming  
(FRQS is dramatically stricter → dominates)

- Filename format: `LASTNAME_XXXXX1234_DocumentTitle.pdf`
- `LASTNAME`: family name, no accents
- `XXXXX1234`: FRQ identification number
- `DocumentTitle`: short, descriptive
- Maximum 50 characters
- Must contain **only one dot**, before `.pdf`
- No spaces
- Forbidden characters:`( Ç é É ê Ê î Î ô Ô û Û à è ò ù ì Ì À È Ò Ù \ ' ~ ! @ % ^ & * ( ) = { } [ ] ; : " | , / < > ? . )`
- On Mac, file must explicitly end with `.PDF`

---

## 9. Document Identification Inside the PDF

- CIHR: No identity information required inside headers/footers
- FRQS: Header: **Candidate’s Last name, First name**; Footer: **Document name or title**

*(Contradiction → both listed)*

---

## 10. Language

- CIHR: English or French accepted
- FRQS: Forms must be in French; attachments may be in French or English

*(Contradiction → both listed)*

---

## 11. Hyperlinks

- Hyperlinks are permitted
- The application **must not rely on external content**
- The document must be **fully self-contained**
- No guarantee that links will be accessed

---

## 12. General Principle

- The PDF must be:
- Fully readable
- Self-contained: The tri-agency CV should include all necessary and relevant information so that reviewers can understand, evaluate and make decisions based on the CV without needing to refer to other documents outside of the application (e.g., information on the web). The CV (along with the application) must stand alone and provide all relevant details to support clear and informed decision making. The sole exception for which other sources may be permitted is for hyperlinks, but only if they are used to demonstrate audio/visual creative outputs, if applicable for specific funding opportunities. However, there is no guarantee that hyperlinks will be accessed.
- Administratively traceable (FRQS)
- Reviewer-fair and formatting-neutral (CIHR)

---

This merged specification is safe for **both CIHR and FRQS**.  
It follows the **strictest interpretation wherever possible** and preserves contradictions where policy intent differs.
