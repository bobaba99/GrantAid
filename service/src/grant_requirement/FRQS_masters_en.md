If one or both of the above conditions are not met, the applicant remains eligible provided they submit proof of admission to a program of study at a Quebec university or the consent form from their research supervisor (see section 4.3). Furthermore, they must complete their training in Quebec (see section 3.6).

Applications with a lower cumulative grade point average (CGPA) are not eligible. For more information on the FRQ's equivalency requirements, consult the Table of Equivalencies for the minimum CGPA required  by the sector to which you are applying. If the CGPA is expressed on a value not listed in this Table, the applicant must demonstrate that their CGPA is at least equivalent to the required threshold. The FRQ reserves the right to refuse an application based on the explanations provided or the absence of the required demonstration.

## Eligibility Period

To apply to the regular stream, the applicant must have been enrolled in the master's program for a maximum of 3 full-time sessions before May 1, 2026  .

# Required documents from the applicant

## RAMQ card, proof of admission or consent form

Applicants who are Canadian citizens or Canadian permanent residents must include the following with their application form:
- a valid Quebec Health Insurance Card (RAMQ) as of the contest deadline, or
- proof that a card has been requested from RAMQ and that it will be valid on the contest deadline, or
- if she is in the process of renewing her RAMQ card on the contest deadline, proof that a new card has been requested from RAMQ and a copy of her expired card.

In accordance with section 3.6 of these rules, applicants who do not hold Canadian citizenship or Canadian permanent residency, or who do not hold one of the above-mentioned documents, remain eligible for this competition but must complete their training at a university in Quebec. They must then submit one of these two documents:
- proof of admission to a program of study at a university in Quebec, or
- a consent form from the person directing the research at a Quebec university, according to the procedure described in section 4.3

## Transcripts

Any missing, incomplete, illegible, unofficial, non-compliant, or outdated transcript will render the application inadmissible.

A copy of all transcripts is required for all university studies undertaken by the applicant, whether completed or not. This includes transcripts obtained through exchange programs or courses that led to transfer credits, if applicable. Transcripts must show all results obtained in all university courses and training programs completed.

For an ongoing program of study, the transcript must:
- to be up-to-date, meaning that it must have been issued no earlier than July of the year the competition opens, and
- submit all results obtained in the last session completed before the competition deadline, including the summer session, if applicable

The elements that make a transcript official may differ from one university to another. However, each transcript must, in order to be considered official by the Fund:
- be issued by the relevant university institution, and
- present the elements indicating that it is an official transcript for this university. This may include the presence of the university's seal or the registrar's signature, or the words "Official Transcript", etc.

A watermark does not render a transcript unofficial, provided the requirements specified above are met. A transcript delivered in a sealed envelope by the Registrar's Office may be opened and its contents scanned. Transcripts available online must be converted to PDF and attached to the application in the appropriate section of the form. If there is any doubt about the authenticity of a transcript, the Fund reserves the right to verify it with the applicant and, if necessary, with the institution concerned.

Other documents to be attached, if applicable, to the file with the transcripts:
- In the case of transcripts obtained outside North America, or when the average is expressed on a value not listed in the Equivalency Table , a document explaining the applicable grading system and/or demonstrating that the cumulative average obtained is at least equivalent to the required threshold must be included. The document attached to the application must clearly explain the grading system used to ensure a proper understanding of the transcripts by the FRQ and the evaluation committee.
- If no transcript is issued, an explanatory document from the institution (registrar's office or equivalent administrative body) detailing the reasons for the missing transcripts will be provided. The Fund reserves the right to verify the validity of the reasons given.
- If no transcript is issued and the applicant is unable to obtain an explanatory document from the university, an explanatory document from the applicant, endorsed by the competent authority of the host institution, justifying the absence of transcripts, will be required. The Fund reserves the right to verify the validity of the reasons given.

## History of part-time or non-registration sessions

Applicants who have been enrolled part-time, or not enrolled at all, in one or more sessions since the start of the training program for which the scholarship is requested, must provide:
- A certificate from the registrar's office indicating the session history or any other official document issued by a competent authority of the university specifying sessions completed part-time or without registration.

- **Bibliography** (maximum 1 page): Applicants must list a maximum of 10 references used in the description of the proposed research. In accordance with Article 3.2 of the General Rules and Regulations (RGC), hyperlinks to web pages may be included, in the manner of bibliographic references, where relevant.

This demonstration must be attached to the "Title and research area" section of the form.

## Documents for exceptional measures

Applicants wishing to take advantage of an exception regarding the eligibility period (see section 3.3.3) must provide:
- **Justification for the request for an extension or exemption from the eligibility period** (maximum 1 page): The applicant must explain the request for an exception and, in the case of a request for an extension, provide the dates and duration of the interruptions, as well as the rate of slowdown in activities, if applicable.
